<center><h1>Welcome to the Machine Learning in Mental Health Lab</h1></center>
We are a multi-disciplinary group of researchers based at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (King's College London). We develop and apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods to investigate a range of mental health disorders, with a particular focus on psychosis. A core aim of our research is to develop and validate clinical tools that could be used to inform diagnosis and treatment of individual patients.<br>
<br>
We have expertise in several machine learning techniques: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Support Vector Machines</li>
  <li>Deep Neural Networks</li>
  <li>Convolutional Neural Networks</li>
</ul>
<br>
We have extensive experience in the application of these techniques to different types of data:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Neuroimaging</li>
  <li>Clinical data</li>
  <li>Smartphone-based data</li>
  <li>Cognitive data</li>
</ul>

We work collaboratively and are happy to share our programming codes, publications and resources with the wider research community here.
If you have questions about our research or would like to explore a possible collaboration, please do not hesitate to get in touch @ <a href="mailto:mlmh@kcl.ac.uk">mlmh@kcl.ac.uk</a>
