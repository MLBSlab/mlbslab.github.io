Hey! I am a computer scientist and an engineer with a PhD in Neuroscience and Cognition from Universidade Federal do ABC (Brazil). Through my carrer, I realized how with the current explosion of technologies producing large scale measurements in neuroimaging applied to psychiatry and neurology it has became a field of research where one can develop interesting computational strategies and make discoveries. I have a long-time interest in machine learning methods (especially Deep Learning) and neuroimaging, focusing mainly on leveraging the power of next-generation tools. Before joining the lab, I was working in Brazil as a Assistant Professor where I was developing my teaching skills.
