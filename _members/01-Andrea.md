The focus of my research is the identification of predictors of disease onset and treatment response in psychosis. This involves the application of machine learning methods to genetic, multi-modal imaging, cognitive and psychosocial data. A core aim of my programme is to exploit the translational potential of this information, using it to inform the development and evaluation of novel tools for early detection and treatment.

In the past few years I have also been pursuing a new line of research, involving the use of smartphone technologies to monitor the impact of the surrounding environment on mental health in real time. As part of this line of research I have developed [Urban Mind](https://www.urbanmind.info), a cross-disciplinary project which brings together clinicians, neuroscientists, social scientists, urban planners and designers, architects and artists with a shared interest in urban mental health.
